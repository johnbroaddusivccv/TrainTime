This App will calculate the time A train will arrive in real time.  Using Moment.js to manipulate real time and firebase to store data this project would be a good fork for someone who is just getting into using firebase or moment.js.  It was my first time using it and I found it to be really frustrating storing data and using moment correctly. all code is working as it should as far as I know. Any input is valued.
